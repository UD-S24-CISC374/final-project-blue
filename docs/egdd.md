# Boolean Bonanza

## Immerse yourself in a world of brain-teasing challenges and strategic gameplay. With each level, sharpen your logical reasoning skills as you complete puzzles.



## Influences (Brief)

- Yoshi’s Cookie:
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: Yoshi’s Cookie is a puzzle game in which players arrange cookies to create matches in rows or columns. Our game utilizes a similar mechanic in which players arrange and match objects in rows and columns.
- Candy Crush:
  - Medium: Games	
  - Explanation: Candy Crush is a puzzle game where players swap adjacent candies to create matches of three or more of the same color. Players progress through levels by completing objectives within a limited number of moves or time limit. Our game plans on utilizing similar objectives and level progressions where the levels get more challenging.


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Click on two tiles to swap: Players click on two tiles which will highlight them upon selection and swap them. If there is a row/column that results in true, then that row/column of tiles will turn white.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

- Boolean logic
## Target Audiences

- Students studying computer science, programming, logic, mathematics, or related subjects.
- Programming beginners who are new to programming

## Target Contexts

This would be practice in a course teaching about logic, truth tables, and relevant topics.

## Learning Objectives

- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to identify which boolean expressions result in true.
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to construct complex boolean expressions that result in true.
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to quickly solve simple boolean expressions.


## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Prior to the game,  players need to be familiar with logical thinking.
- Prior to the game, players need to know basic mathematical concepts such as numerical comparisons.

## Assessment Measures

A pre and post test to determine whether or not the player can identify/solve puzzles
- Given a puzzle, can the player complete the puzzle?


# What sets this project apart?

- Tutorial Levels: Tutorial levels are interactive and will teach the user some of the logic that is required to complete the puzzles.
- Scaling difficulty: Puzzles are easy to complete but get more complex as the player progresses.


# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

Player clicks on tiles with their mouse and swaps them to make rows/columns.

## Player Modes

- Single Player: upon completion of a puzzle, another puzzle is displayed until reaching the final puzzle.

# Gameplay Objectives

- Achieve a designated score: When you reach score objective, you complete the level and proceed to the next level
- Complete all levels: To beat the game, you have to clear all levels.


# Procedures/Actions

- The player can click on two tiles to swap them.

- After completing a round, another screen will appear showing that the player completed the round and is able to proceed to the next level.


# Rules

- the player has to click on two tiles to swap.
- if the player completes a row/column, the row/column will turn white and can no longer be accessed.


# Objects/Entities

- There is a puzzle that must be solved to earn points.
- There is a scoreboard.
- There is a tutorial to explain how to get a true expression.


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Swapping tiles: The player can click on two different tiles to swap. The player can unselect tiles if they wish to.
- getting a row/column to true: If the player makes a column/row evaluate to true, then their score will increase and the row/column will go white.


    
## Feedback

- Score will increase indicating an expression resulted in true.
- The tiles will go white indicating that they don’t need to be moved anymore.
- Completing a puzzle will allow the player to proceed to the next level.


# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

- Text will appear explaining what the task is and perhaps a tutorial.

## Presentation of Content

- The player will interact with the instructions to make them engaged. That way they will see how statements can evaluate to be true.

## Story (Brief)

- Bowser copycat stole our cake so we need to travel through 4 different islands (4 levels) to get our cake back.

# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

- Think of a retro Mario-themed look. Should generally be happy in the beginning but as the player progresses, the background should be more dark.

## Graphical

- Environment Art/Textures:
  - grassy skies with a few clouds
  - dungeon-like background


## Audio

- Music List (Ambient sound)
  - Somewhat playful

- Sound List (SFX)
  - complete row/column sounds
- level complete sound
